API recon

Note: Find out as much information about the API as possible, to discover its attack surface.

First identify API endpoints, these are the locations from where api's request specific resources.
Example of GET request:
GET /api/books HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com 

Endpoint: /api/books 
Purpose: API to retrieve a list of books from a library

Second how to interact with the endpoints.
Construct valid HTTP requests to test the API.

Main focus should be on the following:
1. Input data: Both compulsory and optional parameters.
2. Type of requests: All possible type of request the API accepts including supported HTTP methods and media formats.
3. Rate limits and Auth mechanisms.
