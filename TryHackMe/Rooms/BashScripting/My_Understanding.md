Introduction to Bash scripting

What is bash?
Bash is a scripting language that runs within the terminal on most Linux distros and MacOS. Shell scripts are a sequence of bash commands within a file, combined to achieve more complex tasks than simple one-liners, and are especially useful when automating sysadmin tasks such as backups.

The basic structure of a bash script 
The script always starts with #!/bin/bash as its first line and the rest of the task/script comes next.
