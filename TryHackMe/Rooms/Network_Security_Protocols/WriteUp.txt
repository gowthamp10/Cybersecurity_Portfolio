Introduction

A network protocol is a pre-defined set of rules and processes to determine how data is transmitted between devices, such as end-user devices, networking devices, and servers. 
The fundamental objective of all protocols is to allow machines to connect and communicate seamlessly, regardless of any difference in their internal design, structure, logic, or operation. 
In analogy, a networking protocol is like a “common language” that helps make communication possible among people with different native languages and from various parts of the globe.
