Room: Windows Powershell

Introduction

Learning Objectives
This is the second room in the Command Line module. It is an introductory room to PowerShell, the second—only historically—command-line utility built for the Windows operating system.

Learn what PowerShell is and its capabilities.
Understand the basic structure of PowerShell’s language.
Learn and run some basic PowerShell commands.
Understand PowerShell’s many applications in the cyber security industry.

What Is PowerShell

PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation solution made up of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework

PowerShell is a powerful tool from Microsoft designed for task automation and configuration management. It combines a command-line interface and a scripting language built on the .NET framework. 
Unlike older text-based command-line tools, PowerShell is object-oriented, which means it can handle complex data types and interact with system components more effectively

The Power in PowerShell

In programming, an object represents an item with properties (characteristics) and methods (actions). 
For example, a car object might have properties like Color, Model, and FuelLevel, and methods like Drive(), HonkHorn(), and Refuel().

Similarly, in PowerShell, objects are fundamental units that encapsulate data and functionality, making it easier to manage and manipulate information. 
An object in PowerShell can contain file names, usernames or sizes as data (properties), and carry functions (methods) such as copying a file or stopping a process.

The traditional Command Shell’s basic commands are text-based, meaning they process and output data as plain text. Instead, when a cmdlet (pronounced command-let) is run in PowerShell, it returns objects that retain their properties and methods. 
This allows for more powerful and flexible data manipulation since these objects do not require additional parsing of text.

Question 1: What do we call the advanced approach used to develop PowerShell?
Ans: object-oriented 

PowerShell Basics

Launching PowerShell

These are some of the possible ways to launch:

Start Menu: Type powershell in the Windows Start Menu search bar, then click on Windows PowerShell or PowerShell from the results.
Run Dialog: Press Win + R to open the Run dialog, type powershell, and hit Enter.
File Explorer: Navigate to any folder, then type powershell in the address bar, and press Enter. This opens PowerShell in that specific directory.
Task Manager: Open the Task Manager, go to File > Run new task, type powershell, and press Enter.

Alternatively, PowerShell can be launched from a Command Prompt (cmd.exe) by typing powershell, and pressing Enter.

Basic Syntax: Verb-Noun
PowerShell commands are known as cmdlets (pronounced command-lets). They are much more powerful than the traditional Windows commands and allow for more advanced data manipulation.

Cmdlets follow a consistent Verb-Noun naming convention. This structure makes it easy to understand what each cmdlet does. The Verb describes the action, and the Noun specifies the object on which action is performed. 
For example:
Get-Content: Retrieves (gets) the content of a file and displays it in the console.
Set-Location: Changes (sets) the current working directory. 

Basic Cmdlets

Get-Command: It’s an essential tool for discovering what commands one can use. CommandInfo object retrieved by the cmdlet
Filter the list of commands based on displayed property values. For example, if we want to display only the available commands of type “function”, we can use -CommandType "Function"
Get-Help: it provides detailed information about cmdlets, including usage, parameters, and examples. It’s the go-to cmdlet for learning how to use PowerShell commands.
Get-Alias: lists all aliases available

Where to Find and Download Cmdlets

Find-Module: Cmdlet can be used to find the repository for particular command-lets. 
Syntax: Find-Module <Filtering_Type> <Filter>
Example: Find-Module -Name Power*
Install-Module: Cmdlet can be used to install the command let to the local system from the remote repository.
Syntax: Find-Module <Filtering_Type> <Desired-Cmdlet>
Example: Find-Module -Name PowerShellGet

Question 2: How would you retrieve a list of commands that start with the verb Remove? [for the sake of this question, avoid the use of quotes (" or ') in your answer]
Ans: Get-Command -Name Remove*

Question 3: What cmdlet has its traditional counterpart echo as an alias?
Ans: Write-Output

Question 4: What is the command to retrieve some example usage for the cmdlet New-LocalUser?
Ans: Get-Help New-LocalUser -Examples

Navigating the File System and Working with Files

Similar to the dir command in Command Prompt (or ls in Unix-like systems), Get-ChildItem lists the files and directories in a location specified with the -Path parameter. 
It can be used to explore directories and view their contents. If no Path is specified, the cmdlet will display the content of the current working directory.

To navigate to a different directory, we can use the Set-Location cmdlet. It changes the current directory, bringing us to the specified path, akin to the cd command in Command Prompt.

To create an item in PowerShell, we can use New-Item. We will need to specify the path of the item and its type (whether it is a file or a directory).

Remove-Item cmdlet removes both directories and files, whereas in Windows CLI we have separate commands rmdir and del.

copy or move files and directories alike, using respectively Copy-Item (equivalent to copy) and Move-Item (equivalent to move).

read and display the contents of a file, we can use the Get-Content cmdlet, which works similarly to the type command in Command Prompt (or cat in Unix-like systems).

Question 5:What cmdlet can you use instead of the traditional Windows command type?
Ans:Get-Content

Question 6:What PowerShell command would you use to display the content of the "C:\Users" directory? [for the sake of this question, avoid the use of quotes (" or ') in your answer]
Ans: Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users

Question 7:How many items are displayed by the command described in the previous question?
Ans:4
