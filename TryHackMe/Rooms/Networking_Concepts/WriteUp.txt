Learning Objectives
By the time you finish this room, you will have learned about the following:
- ISO OSI network model
- IP addresses, subnets, and routing
- TCP, UDP, and port numbers
- How to connect to an open TCP port from the command line

OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual model developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that describes how communications should occur in a computer network. In other words, the OSI model defines a framework for computer network communications. Although this model is theoretical, it is vital to learn and understand as it helps grasp networking concepts on a deeper level. 
The OSI model is composed of seven layers:
Physical Layer
Data Link Layer
Network Layer
Transport Layer
Session Layer
Presentation Layer
Application Layer

Layer 1: Physical Layer
The physical layer, also referred to as layer 1, deals with the physical connection between devices; this includes the medium, such as a wire, and the definition of the binary digits 0 and 1. Data transmission can be via an electrical, optical, or wireless signal. Consequently, we need data cables or antennas, depending on our physical medium.

Layer 2: Data Link Layer
The physical layer defines a medium to transmit our signal. The data link layer, i.e., layer 2, represents the protocol that enables data transfer between nodes on the same network segment. 
The data link layer describes an agreement between the different systems on the same network segment on how to communicate.
