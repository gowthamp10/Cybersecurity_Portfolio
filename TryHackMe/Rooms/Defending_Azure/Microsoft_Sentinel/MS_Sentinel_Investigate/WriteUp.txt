Events / Alerts / Incidents

Real-Life Analogy - House Monitoring System
To better understand the similarities and differences between events, alerts, and incidents, let's imagine a typical daily scenario: a House Monitoring System.

Imagine a 24/7 camera monitoring the entrance of a house. This camera will surely capture many snapshots of activities happening. Let's further assume a family of 3-4 household members living there. Surely, this family will go about their days and will be entering and exiting the house, back and forth, many times during the day.

With this background context, consider the following situations in which each moment is captured by the camera. Let's use these moments to explain events, alerts, and incidents.
Event:
    Who: Household members - adults or children
    When: Daytime
    What (activity):
        Entering or exiting the house
        Playing by the entrance
        Household vehicle parking on the driveway or entering the garage
    Activity classification:
        Normal activity
        Neither good or bad

Alert:
    Who: Food delivery or mail persons
    When: Daytime or early evening
    What (activity):
        Leaving the delivery or mail by the door
    Activity classification:
        Out of the daily norm
        It could be good or bad
        Requires a review and action

Incident:
    Who: A hooded, masked stranger
    When: Late in the night
    What (activity):
        Passing by the house and garage entrance
        Recorded multiple times by the camera during the night
        Triggering flood lights
        Finally, it was recorded while carrying garage tools
    Activity classification:
        Definitely abnormal
        Definitely bad
        Potentially dangerous and could cause harm
        Disruptive
        Requires intervention

Event: Any observable change or occurrence within a system could be routine, informational, or indicative of issues.
All technology devices create events in the form of log entries and regular status updates, which are recorded as event data in various databases and other files.
Security posture:
A point in time representing the state of service

Alert: A notification triggered by an event designed to inform stakeholders of a situation that needs attention.	
Security posture:
Certain event(s) that meet a threshold

Incident: A specific kind of negative event that disrupts normal operations or services and requires intervention.	
Security posture:
Contains correlated alerts that indicate impact, disruptive issue, or breach

Note: Event data can be vast; in this case, only certain events passing defined thresholds will be categorized as alerts. In the context of Microsoft Sentinel, these rules and thresholds are defined in Analytics rules.

Question 1: What is a normal activity that happens at a point in time, neither good nor bad called?
Answer: event

Question 2: What is a negative event that disrupts normal operations and requires investigation called?
Answer: incident


Incidents Overview

How Microsoft Sentinel presents these concepts and what additional information is available for investigation.
1. Showing the number of Open, New, and Active incidents.
2. Show all incidents based on the filters applied, e.g., the last 30 days.
3. Incident management details for the selected incident: This part will be relevant later when we discuss triaging and taking ownership of an incident.
        Owner: Unassigned or assigned owner
        Status: New, Active, Closed
        Severity: High, Medium, Low, Informational
4. Evidence: Events and Alerts related to the selected incident.

The right pane only summarizes the incident; more details can be found by clicking "View full details" for investigation purposes. MITRE Tactics and Techniques mapped to this incident can also be seen on the incident overview pane.

Note: It is also important to note that the source of alerts resulting in incidents may not always be Microsoft Sentinel itself.

Question 3: Is Microsoft Sentinel the only product contributing to incidents? (Yea/Nay)
Answer: Yea


Triage and Investigate - Ownership, Status, Tasks

Incident Ownership:
In a standard setting, every incident must be allocated to a designated security team member. This individual, known as the incident owner, is responsible for overseeing the entire incident management process, encompassing investigation and providing status updates. Ownership can be transferred at any point to delegate the incident to another member of the security team for additional investigation or escalation.

As for a SOC analyst, triaging and investigating an incident usually starts by taking ownership of the incident by changing the owner and status. 
This could be done from the incident overview pane by:
1. Assigning the incident owner to yourself.
2. Changing the incident status from New to Active.

Incident Severity:
The severity of an incident is initially determined by the rule or Microsoft security source that triggered it. Typically, the severity of an incident remains unchanged, but there's the possibility of adjusting it if you determine that the initial classification is inaccurate. Severity options range from Informational, Low, Medium, to High.

Using the incident overview pane, you can also add tags and take some initial actions for the incident, such as:
1. Investigate
2. Run playbook
3. Create automation rule
4. Create team

Incident Details:
When it's time for a more in-depth investigation, the Incident Details page will reveal many details for the SOC analyst. 
By clicking "View full details", we get to the page where most investigation actions can be performed.

At the top of the page, you can find:
1. Logs: To open the Log Analytics query window
2. Tasks: To see the tasks assigned for the incident
3. Activity log: To see any actions taken for the incident

Incident Tasks:
Ensuring the smooth and efficient operation of security operations (SecOps) hinges greatly on process standardization. SOC analysts are tasked with a series of stepsâ€”triaging, investigating, or remediating incidents; hence, formalizing these procedures is crucial. By establishing a standardized list of tasks, your Security Operations Center (SOC) can maintain consistency across all analysts, regardless of their shifts.

Note: This approach guarantees that every incident receives uniform treatment and adheres to Service Level Agreements (SLAs). With predefined steps set by SOC management or senior analysts (lvl 2/3), drawing from common security frameworks like NIST, past incident experience, or recommendations from security vendors, analysts can work efficiently without deliberating on the next steps or fearing missing critical actions.

Question 4: What ensures the smooth and efficient operation of security operations (SecOps)?
Answer: process standardization

Question 5: What helps to guarantee that every incident receives uniform treatment?
Answer: incident tasks


Triage and Investigate - Timeline, Logs, Entities, Visual

Incident Timeline:
Is particularly helpful for seeing the timeline of an attacker's activity. Here, you can also search the alerts by severity and tactics to narrow down the ones you want to investigate further.

Investigate With Logs:
To investigate a specific alert without leaving the incident details page, click "Link to LA". This will bring up the Log Analytics Query page, where we can further analyze this alert.
Based on the rule logic, certain entities could be of interest here, such as IP addresses, accounts, etc.

Incident Entities:
When Microsoft Sentinel generates alerts, they contain data items that Sentinel can recognize and classify into categories as entities. 

Here are some entity types recognized by Microsoft Sentinel:
1. Account
2. Host
3. IP address
4. URL
5. Malware
6. Process
Knowing the IP address entity involved in the incident, incident enhancement playbooks can be applied to provide more context for this IP. For instance, these automation playbooks can call APIs such as IP-API to get geolocation details for the IP.

Visual Investigation:
Incidents can also be investigated visually. If you prefer a visual, graphical representation of alerts, entities, and the connections between them in your investigation, you can do so by clicking the Investigate button on the Incident Details page.
You can further deepen your investigation by hovering over each entity. This will show a list of additional questions per entity type. These are called exploration queries.

Note: Microsoft Sentinel offers many investigation features. Effective use of each will contribute to the overall investigation and evidence gathering. The output of these tools and features will also depend on incident remediation options and incident closure.

Question 6: Which link can you click to see the specific logs of an alert without leaving the context of the incident details page?
Answer: Link to LA

Question 7: During graphical investigation, which queries can be utilized to deepen the investigation?
Answer: exploration

Incident Closure - True / Benign / False Positives

Closing Incidents:
When an incident is generated in Microsoft Sentinel, it is automatically labelled as "New". As you access and address these incidents, manually update their status to accurately represent their current state. For incidents undergoing investigation, you designate the status as "Active". Once an incident is completely resolved, mark it as "Closed".

Upon setting the status to "Closed", you will be prompted to select one of the following classifications:
Classification	        Description
True Positive	    Suspicious activity
Benign Positive     Suspicious but expected
False Positive	    Incorrect alert logic
False Positive	    Inaccurate data
Undetermined	            ---

True Positive - Suspicious Activity
    The root cause was an actual threat.

Benign Positive - Suspicious but Expected
    The action detected is real but not malicious. For instance:
        Penetration tests
        Elevating privileges to deploy system updates

False Positive - Inaccurate Data
    Data contained in the incident details is inaccurate
        Wrong user account, IP, etc.
        Analytics rule may need tuning

False Positive - Incorrect Alert Logic
Microsoft Sentinel Analytics rules alert you when suspicious activity arises within your network. Recognizing that no analytics rule is flawless, it's inevitable that you'll encounter false positives requiring attention.

Some false positives can occur due to some common activities, such as the following:
    Routine activities performed by certain users, often service principals, exhibit patterns that appear suspicious
    Purposeful security scanning originating from recognized IP addresses being flagged as malicious
    A rule designed to exclude private IP addresses may inadvertently include some internal IP addresses that aren't private

On a high level, these false positives can be eliminated with the following methods:
1. Automation rules
    By creating exceptions without modifying Analytics rules
2. Scheduled Analytics rules modifications
    By allowing more detailed and permanent exceptions
3. Undetermined
    You are unable to determine the cause of the incident
    You might get a similar incident in the future; however, for the current, you don't have enough info for a conclusion

Note: Use Undetermined only on rare occasions. Ideally, every incident needs closure with a definite answer as to its root cause.

As a supplement, read the Microsoft guide on "investigating Microsoft Sentinel incidents in depth in the Azure portal".

Question 8: You investigate an incident and conclude that it is due to red team activities. What is your closure classification?
Answer: benign positive

Question 9: How do you eliminate a false positive without modifying the analytics rule?
Answer: automation rule

Question 10: What do you classify an actual threat as?
Answer: true positive
