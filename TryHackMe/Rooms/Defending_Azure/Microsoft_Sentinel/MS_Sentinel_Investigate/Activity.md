# Activity performed as part of "MS Sentinel: Ingest Data" Room

- **Lab-05: Investigate Incidents** :

Lab scenario: As a SOC LVL 1 Analyst, you need to start triaging and investigating the incidents. You will:
1. First, review open incidents and take ownership
2. Then, investigate the incident
3. Finally, escalate the incident to SOC LVL 2 for in-depth investigation and threat hunting

1: Investigate Incidents - Take Ownership

1. Go back to your Microsoft Sentinel workspace's Incidents page under Threat management.
2. You should see 3 open and new incidents.
(Note: Since this is a live environment, and due to the run frequency of Analytics rules, it might take a while for the incidents to appear here.)
3. Select each open incident and review their incident descriptions on the right pane.
4. You decided to take ownership of the Solorigate incident. To take ownership, use the right details pane and assign the incident to your lab user.
5. Also, update the Status from New to Active.
