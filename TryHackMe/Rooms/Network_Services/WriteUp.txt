Understanding SMB

What is SMB?
SMB - Server Message Block Protocol - is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network.

The SMB protocol is known as a response-request protocol, meaning that it transmits multiple messages between the client and server to establish a connection. Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI or IPX/SPX.

What runs SMB?
Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows 95 have included client and server SMB protocol support. Samba, an open source server that supports the SMB protocol, was released for Unix systems.

Question 1:What does SMB stand for?
Ans:Server Message Block

Question 2:What type of protocol is SMB?
Ans:response-request

Question 3:What do clients connect to servers using? 
Ans:TCP/IP

Question 4:What systems does Samba run on?
Ans:Unix

Enumerating SMB

Enumeration:
Enumeration is the process of gathering information on a target in order to find potential attack vectors and aid in exploitation.

SMB:
SMB share drives on a server that can be connected to and used to view or transfer files. SMB can often be a great starting point for an attacker looking to discover sensitive information â€” you'd be surprised what is sometimes included on these shares.

Port Scanning:
Find out as much information as you can about the services, applications, structure and operating system of the target machine.

Enum4Linux:
Enum4linux is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares on both Windows and Linux systems. It is basically a wrapper around the tools in the Samba package and makes it easy to quickly extract information from the target pertaining to SMB.
It's already installed on the AttackBox, however if you need to install it on your own attacking machine, you can do so from the official github:https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux.

Syntax:"enum4linux [options] ip"

few options which can help are:
TAG            FUNCTION

-U             get userlist
-M             get machine list
-N             get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)
-S             get sharelist
-P             get password policy information
-G             get group and member list

-a             all of the above (full basic enumeration)

Question 5:Conduct an nmap scan of your choosing, How many ports are open?
Ans:3

Question 6:What ports is SMB running on?
Ans:139/445

Question 7:Let's get started with Enum4Linux, conduct a full basic enumeration. For starters, what is the workgroup name?    
Ans:WORKGROUP

Question 8:What comes up as the name of the machine?        
Ans:POLOSMB

Question 9:What operating system version is running?
Ans:6.1

Question 10:What share sticks out as something we might want to investigate?  
Ans:profiles
