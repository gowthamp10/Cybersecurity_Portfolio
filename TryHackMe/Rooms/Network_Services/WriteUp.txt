Understanding SMB

What is SMB?
SMB - Server Message Block Protocol - is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network.

The SMB protocol is known as a response-request protocol, meaning that it transmits multiple messages between the client and server to establish a connection. Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI or IPX/SPX.

What runs SMB?
Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows 95 have included client and server SMB protocol support. Samba, an open source server that supports the SMB protocol, was released for Unix systems.

Question 1:What does SMB stand for?
Ans:Server Message Block

Question 2:What type of protocol is SMB?
Ans:response-request

Question 3:What do clients connect to servers using? 
Ans:TCP/IP

Question 4:What systems does Samba run on?
Ans:Unix

Enumerating SMB

Enumeration:
Enumeration is the process of gathering information on a target in order to find potential attack vectors and aid in exploitation.

SMB:
SMB share drives on a server that can be connected to and used to view or transfer files. SMB can often be a great starting point for an attacker looking to discover sensitive information â€” you'd be surprised what is sometimes included on these shares.

Port Scanning:
Find out as much information as you can about the services, applications, structure and operating system of the target machine.

Enum4Linux:
Enum4linux is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares on both Windows and Linux systems. It is basically a wrapper around the tools in the Samba package and makes it easy to quickly extract information from the target pertaining to SMB.
It's already installed on the AttackBox, however if you need to install it on your own attacking machine, you can do so from the official github:https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux.

Syntax:"enum4linux [options] ip"

few options which can help are:
TAG            FUNCTION

-U             get userlist
-M             get machine list
-N             get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)
-S             get sharelist
-P             get password policy information
-G             get group and member list

-a             all of the above (full basic enumeration)

Question 5:Conduct an nmap scan of your choosing, How many ports are open?
Ans:3

Question 6:What ports is SMB running on?
Ans:139/445

Question 7:Let's get started with Enum4Linux, conduct a full basic enumeration. For starters, what is the workgroup name?    
Ans:WORKGROUP

Question 8:What comes up as the name of the machine?        
Ans:POLOSMB

Question 9:What operating system version is running?
Ans:6.1

Question 10:What share sticks out as something we might want to investigate?  
Ans:profiles

Exploiting SMB

Types of SMB Exploit

exploiting anonymous SMB share access- a common misconfiguration that can allow us to gain information that will lead to a shell.
In many case vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-7494, can allow remote code execution by exploiting SMB.

Method Breakdown

from our enumeration stage, we know:
    - The SMB share location
    - The name of an interesting SMB share
The above details are both related to profiles which we can across in Share information of enum4linux enumeration.

SMBClient
Because we're trying to access an SMB share, we need a client to access resources on servers. We will be using SMBClient because it's part of the default samba suite. 

syntax: "smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE]"

Question 11: What would be the correct syntax to access an SMB share called "secret" as user "suit" on a machine with the IP 10.10.10.2 on the default port?
Ans: smbclient //10.10.10.2/secret -U suit -p 445

Question 12: Does the share allow anonymous access? Y/N?
Ans: Y

Question 13:Great! Have a look around for any interesting documents that could contain valuable information. Who can we assume this profile folder belongs to?
Ans: John Cactus

Question 14: What service has been configured to allow him to work from home?
Ans: ssh

Question 15: Okay! Now we know this, what directory on the share should we look in?
Ans: .ssh

Question 16: This directory contains authentication keys that allow a user to authenticate themselves on, and then access, a server. Which of these keys is most useful to us?
Ans: id_rsa

Question 17: What is the smb.txt flag?
Ans: THM{smb_is_fun_eh?}

Understanding Telnet

What is Telnet?
Telnet is an application protocol which allows you, with the use of a telnet client, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server.
The telnet client will establish a connection with the server. The client will then become a virtual terminal- allowing you to interact with the remote host.

Replacement: As telent uses no encryption or masking while sending the data most of the implemetions are replaced with ssh.

How does Telnet work?
The user connects to the server by using the Telnet protocol, which means entering "telnet" into a command prompt. The user then executes commands on the server by using specific Telnet commands in the Telnet prompt.
Syntax: "telnet [ip] [port]"

Question 18: What is Telnet?
Ans: application protocol

Question 19: What has slowly replaced Telnet?    
Ans: ssh

Question 20: How would you connect to a Telnet server with the IP 10.10.10.3 on port 23?
Ans: telnet 10.10.10.3 23

Question 21: The lack of what, means that all Telnet communication is in plaintext?
Ans: encryption

Enumerating Telnet

NOTE: when it comes to enumerating network services, we need to be thorough in our method.
Port Scanning
find out as much information as we can about the services, applications, structure and operating system of the target machine. 


Question 22:How many ports are open on the target machine?    
Ans:1

Question 23:What port is this?
Ans:8012

Question 24:This port is unassigned, but still lists the protocol it's using, what protocol is this?
Ans:tcp

Question 25:Now re-run the nmap scan, without the -p- tag, how many ports show up as open?
Ans:0

NOTE: Here, we see that by assigning telnet to a non-standard port, it is not part of the common ports list, or top 1000 ports, that nmap scans. 
It's important to try every angle when enumerating, as the information you gather here will inform your exploitation stage.
Question 26:Based on the title returned to us, what do we think this port could be used for?
Ans: 

Question 27: Who could it belong to? Gathering possible usernames is an important step in enumeration.
Ans: 

NOTE: Always keep a note of information you find during your enumeration stage, so you can refer back to it when you move on to try exploits.
