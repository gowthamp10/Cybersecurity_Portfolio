Here’s what the code is doing, in plain English and with a worked example.

# What the snippet does

1. `from secret import FLAG`
   Imports a (presumably secret) string named `FLAG`.

2. Defines `enc(plaintext)`
   This function **encrypts** a string using a *position-based Caesar shift*:

   * Walk through the text character by character with `enumerate(plaintext)`, so each char has an index `i = 0,1,2,...`.
   * If the character is a letter:

     * Pick a **base** of `ord('A')` for uppercase or `ord('a')` for lowercase (so we keep the case).
     * Convert the letter to a 0–25 number with `ord(c) - base`.
     * **Shift by `i`** (the position) and wrap within the alphabet: `(pos + i) % 26`.
     * Convert back to a letter with `chr(... + base)`.
   * If it isn’t a letter (space, digit, punctuation), leave it unchanged.
   * The code uses the **walrus operator** `:=` to compute and reuse `base` inside the expression.

3. Writes the encrypted `FLAG` to `message.txt`.

So effectively:

* 1st character (index 0) is shifted by 0
* 2nd character (index 1) is shifted by 1
* 3rd by 2, and so on…
* **Non-letters still advance the index** (because `enumerate` counts every character), even though they themselves aren’t changed.

This is a “no-key” scheme; security-wise it’s just a toy cipher.

# Line-by-line, compact

```py
def enc(plaintext):
    return "".join(
        # For each (i, c) in plaintext...
        chr((ord(c) - (base := ord('A') if c.isupper() else ord('a')) + i) % 26 + base)
        # If it's a letter: normalize to 0–25, add i, wrap, re-add base
        if c.isalpha() else c
        # Otherwise keep it as-is
        for i, c in enumerate(plaintext)
    )
```

* `enumerate(plaintext)` gives `(i, c)` pairs.
* `c.isalpha()` guards letters vs non-letters.
* `(base := ...)` is the walrus operator, saving `base` to reuse after the `% 26`.
* `% 26` wraps around the alphabet.
* Case is preserved via the `base` (`'A'` or `'a'`).

# Worked example

Take: `Abc XYZ!`

Encrypted becomes: `Ace BDF!`

Step by step:

|  i | char | isalpha | base | pos (0–25) | shift (=i) | new\_pos | out |
| -: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :--------: | :--------: | :------: | :-: |
|  0 |   A  |   True  |   A  |      0     |      0     |     0    |  A  |
|  1 |   b  |   True  |   a  |      1     |      1     |     2    |  c  |
|  2 |   c  |   True  |   a  |      2     |      2     |     4    |  e  |
|  3 |  ( ) |  False  |      |            |            |          | ( ) |
|  4 |   X  |   True  |   A  |     23     |      4     |     1    |  B  |
|  5 |   Y  |   True  |   A  |     24     |      5     |     3    |  D  |
|  6 |   Z  |   True  |   A  |     25     |      6     |     5    |  F  |
|  7 |   !  |  False  |      |            |            |          |  !  |

Another example:

```py
enc("Attack at dawn.")  # -> "Auvdgp hb nlia."
```

# How to **decrypt** (reverse it)

Just subtract the index `i` instead of adding it:

```py
def dec(ciphertext):
    return "".join(
        chr((ord(c) - (base := ord('A') if c.isupper() else ord('a')) - i) % 26 + base)
        if c.isalpha() else c
        for i, c in enumerate(ciphertext)
    )
```

Round-trip check:

```py
dec(enc("Abc XYZ!"))  # "Abc XYZ!"
```

If you only have `message.txt` (and not `secret.FLAG`), you can still recover the original:

```py
with open("message.txt") as f:
    ct = f.read()
print(dec(ct))
```

> ⚠️ Important: Because `enumerate` counts **every** character, including spaces and punctuation, you must use the exact same indexing rule for decryption. If you tried to increment `i` only for letters, you’d get the wrong answer.

# Notes & gotchas

* **Python version:** Uses the walrus operator `:=` (requires Python 3.8+).
* **Unicode letters:** `str.isalpha()` is `True` for many non-ASCII letters (like `é`). This cipher assumes A–Z or a–z; using `ord('A')/ord('a')` on non-ASCII letters will produce nonsense. If you need strict ASCII only, you might prefer `c in string.ascii_letters`.
* **File write mode:** `open("message.txt", "w")` overwrites the file each run.

# A clearer (more readable) rewrite

Same logic, but expanded for clarity and easy modification:

```py
def enc(plaintext: str) -> str:
    out = []
    for i, c in enumerate(plaintext):
        if c.isalpha():
            base = ord('A') if c.isupper() else ord('a')
            pos = ord(c) - base        # 0..25
            new_pos = (pos + i) % 26   # shift by position i
            out.append(chr(new_pos + base))
        else:
            out.append(c)
    return "".join(out)
```

And the matching decrypt:

```py
def dec(ciphertext: str) -> str:
    out = []
    for i, c in enumerate(ciphertext):
        if c.isalpha():
            base = ord('A') if c.isupper() else ord('a')
            pos = ord(c) - base
            new_pos = (pos - i) % 26
            out.append(chr(new_pos + base))
        else:
            out.append(c)
    return "".join(out)
```

If you’d like, I can adapt it so the index only increments for letters (ignores spaces/punctuation) and show how that changes the result.
